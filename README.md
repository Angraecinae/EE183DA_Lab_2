# EE183DA_Lab_2
## Introduction
This is the README for Lab 2 of EE183DA, Winter 2017. Given a wifi-capable microcontroller (ESP8266), a standard servo, and a continuous-rotation servo, we were tasked to construct an electromechanical device with both autonomous and human-controlled functions, commanded via an internet-based web interface.
