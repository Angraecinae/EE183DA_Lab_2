#The Glass Xylophone (On a Budget)
## Introduction
This is the README for Lab 2 of EE183DA, Winter 2017. Given a wifi-capable microcontroller (ESP12e), a standard servo, and a continuous-rotation servo, we were tasked to construct an electromechanical device with both autonomous and human-controlled functions, commanded via an internet-based web interface.

## Design Description

## Bill of Materials
- ESP12e Microcontroller (1x | $5.95)
- ESP8266 Shield (1x | $14.95)
- Standard Servo (1x | $3.95)
- Continuous-Rotation Servo (1x | $5.95)
- Duct Tape (1x | $2.99)
- Coffee Stirrers (5x | Free if you go to the right places)
- Dime (3x | $0.30)
- Paper Clip Large (1x | $0.10)
- Rubber Bands (4x | $0.40)
- Starbucks Coffee Cold (6-8x | $$$, but I got them used so...)

## Operation Manual
The image below features the main webpage, which contains all the button functions. The notes 'G' through 'E' represent the six manual note options the user can click to play that particular note. The 'Calibrate' function simply runs the device in an ascending then descending scale to allow the user to move the glasses into place to ensure best contact between the striker and glasses. The 'Track 1' option under 'Play Songs' allows the user to play a preset musical track (I only had time to program one tune in, but it's not that difficult to add more).

## Demonstration
The below video demonstrates the glass xylophone in its auto mode, in which it plays Track 1, the melody of Ode to Joy from Beethoven's 9th. 

## Future Improvement(s)
Obviously, the use of duct tape, coffee stirrers, paper clip(s), and rubber bands were intended as low-cost materials with high ease-of-access for the purpose of prototyping and proof-of-concept. A more concrete version should make use of 3-D printing to make more secure mounts and joint connections for the two servos. Ideally, two standard servos should be used as the continuous-rotation servo is not precise enough without the use of guides to serve as a precision striker. The dimes were an easy metallic contact with clearer resonance as a striking element, and were also decent counterweights, but could be replaced by more formal materials. The coffee glasses could be replaced by larger and more resonant (and probably expensive) wine glasses with a broader range, to also allow for more notes to be played (currently limited to 5-6). Additionally, an expansion of its software capabilities, such as the ability to record and save tracks, would greatly increase its playability.
